import { createContext } from "react"; //This line imports the createContext function from the React library. The createContext function is used to create a Context object, which allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.


export const FirebaseContext=createContext(null) //This calls the createContext function to create a new Context object. The null argument specifies the default value for this context. Here, it is set to null, meaning that initially, the context does not have any value.
